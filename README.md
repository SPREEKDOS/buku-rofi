# buku-rofi

A simple integration of [buku](https://github.com/jarun/buku) with [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) to quickly search, edit, delete, and open your bookmarks from a rofi launcher interface.

## Features

- üöÄ Fuzzy search your `buku` bookmarks with the speed of `rofi`
- üîó Open bookmarks directly in your browser
- üé® Minimal, highly customizable interface via `rofi`
- üß© Robust dependency and version checks for trouble-free setup
- üõ†Ô∏è Graceful error messages and portable across major Linux distros

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed and available in your `$PATH`:

- [`buku`](https://github.com/jarun/buku) ‚Äî command-line bookmark manager
- [`rofi`](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) ‚Äî window switcher/launcher
- [`notify-send`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/notify-send.1.html) ‚Äî for desktop notifications
- [`awk`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/) ‚Äî for text processing
- [`fish`](https://fishshell.com/) ‚Äî Version **2.7.0 or higher** recommended (some features require Fish 3+)

To install dependencies on popular distributions:

- **Debian/Ubuntu**:
  ```sh
  sudo apt install buku rofi notify-send awk fish
  ```
- **Arch Linux/Manjaro**:
  ```sh
  sudo pacman -S buku rofi libnotify gawk fish
  ```
- **Fedora**:
  ```sh
  sudo dnf install buku rofi libnotify gawk fish
  ```

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```fish
   git clone https://github.com/SPREEKDOS/buku-rofi.git
   cd buku-rofi
   ```

2. **Symlink the script for easier access in Fish shell** (required, as the script expects `buku-rofi.rasi` to be in the same directory):
   ```fish
   ln -s (pwd)/buku-rofi.fish ~/.config/fish/functions/buku-rofi.fish
   ```

## Usage

Launch the bookmark search interface with:

```fish
buku-rofi
```

- Type to search bookmarks.
- <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open the selected bookmark.
- All required dependencies and your Fish shell version will be checked automatically before launch.
- If a dependency is missing, you'll get a clear error and install suggestion based on your OS.
